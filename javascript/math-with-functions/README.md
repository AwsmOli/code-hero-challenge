# Math-With-Functions Challenge

In this challenge, you need to implement functions that allow you to do arithmetics as shown in the following example:

```javascript
eight(plus(nine())); // Must return 17
five(times(two())); // Must return 10
six(dividedBy(two())) // Must return 3
```

## Notes

- You must implement functions for each number from `one` to `nine`
- You must implement the following operations: `plus`, `minus`, `times`, `dividedBy`

## Testing

- Build your solution in `index.js`
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Run `npm test` or `yarn test`
