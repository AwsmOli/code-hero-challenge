# Array-Sum-Pairs Challenge

In this challenge, you need to implement a function that receives an array of integers (both positive and negative) and returns the first pair of integers that add up to form a given sum.

As an example:

```javascript
getPairs([3, 4, 7, 6], 10); // Must return [3, 7]
```

## Notes

- If no valid pair of integers can be found, return `undefined`
- Your implementation must work for several different arrays of variadic length
- Your implementation will also run against an array of 5.000.000 integers

## Winner

- The Winner will be the one that can submit the most performant version until Friday 2pm CET

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Run `npm test` or `yarn test`
