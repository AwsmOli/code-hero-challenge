# Arr-Sort Challenge (Javascript || Ruby)

In this challenge, you need to implement a function that will receive an array of integers, which must be sorted by the outermost elements to the middle element, traveling counterclockwise.

As an example, given this array:

`[8, 9, 9, 5, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 9, 3, 7, 4, 5]`

You must sort it as depicted here:

![example](./array-sort-example.jpg)

Meaning the solution would be:

`[8, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 5, 9, 0, 5, 9, 9, 0, 4, 6, 6]`

## Notes

- Your implementation must work for three given arrays of the following lengths: 9, 16, 25
